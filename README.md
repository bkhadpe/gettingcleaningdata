The script file run_analysis.R contains all the code for the course project.

The first step is to read all the data from the text files using read.table.

Then the columns in each data frame are named from the features.txt file as well as "Activity" and "Subject" for the columns in the y_ and Subject files.

The remaining sections of the script perform the different steps as required in the course project.
